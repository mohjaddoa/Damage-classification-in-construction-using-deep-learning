# Damage-classification-in-construction-using-deep-learning
### Several Machine learning models have been developed 
### to classify damage in construction.
### These machine learning models include :
### 1-Inception 
### 2-ResNet18
### 3-ResNet50
### 4-VGG

### Transfer learning is used to develop machine learning models. Confusion Matrix is used to measure accuracy and performance.
### PyQt5 used to develop GUI interface
